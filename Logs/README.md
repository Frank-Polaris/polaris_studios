# Logs Folder 🗂️

This directory stores **runtime and debug logs** generated by Python scripts during testing or data processing.

---

## 📘 Purpose
- Keep records of console outputs, error traces, or data verification results.
- Separate raw log files from source code and datasets.
- Facilitate debugging and reproducibility during analysis.

---

## 🧩 Recommended usage
- Save output files as `.txt` or `.log` when testing scripts (e.g. `session_01.log`).
- Avoid committing large or temporary logs to the main branch.
- Keep relevant logs only if they document performance or error-handling behavior.

## ⚙️ Typical files
| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `run_test_01.log` | Sample execution log generated during code testing. |
| `validation_results.txt` | Optional data check or report file. |
